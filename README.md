# Various development boards
This project contains a bunch of various development boards I use in my projects. They are usually focused on learning how to use a specific type of microcontroller or application.
## Nuclone development board series
As the name implies they resemble the [ST nucleo](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32-nucleo-boards.html) in shape and function, minimal evaluation boards with all pins broken out and lot of jumpers.
## Structure
* Hardware contains the schematics and PCB's used by the project
* Software contains the software needed for the project, either embedded or PC side software
* CAD contains drawings of casing/mechanisms etc
## Checking out
This project makes extensive use of submodules, use ```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Squantor/squantorDevelBoards.git``` to clone the repository and its submodules in one go.
