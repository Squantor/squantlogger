# Development board electronics
Stored here is the electronics for various development boards I use. Most are based on the "nuclone" principle. They look a lot like the STM32 nucleo series development boards.
## List of boards
TODO need to document all the entries.

[Wearable electronics test](https://github.com/Squantor/squantorDevelBoards/tree/master/electronics/nuclone_LPC824M201JHI33_expansion_wearable/README.md) contains all the electronics to make a viable datalogger/wearable: Lithium battery charger, SPI serial flash, USB to UART and associated components. It has been made as an expansion board for the [nuclone board for the LPC824M201JHI33](https://github.com/Squantor/squantorDevelBoards/tree/master/electronics/nuclone_LPC824M201JHI33/README.md).

[nuclone board for the LPC824M201JHI33](https://github.com/Squantor/squantorDevelBoards/tree/master/electronics/nuclone_LPC824M201JHI33/README.md) is a breakout for the LPC824M201JHI33 microcontroller.

[nuclone board for the LPC812M101JDH20](https://github.com/Squantor/squantorDevelBoards/tree/master/electronics/nuclone_LPC812M101JDH20/README.md) is a breakout for the LPC812M101JDH20 microcontroller.

[nuclone board for the LPC1125JBD48-303](https://github.com/Squantor/squantorDevelBoards/tree/master/electronics/nuclone_LPC1125JBD48-303/README.md) is a breakout for the LPC1125JBD48-303 microcontroller.
