# Wearable/datalogger test expansion
Small nuclone expansion board for the [LPC824 nuclone](https://github.com/Squantor/squantorDevelBoards/tree/master/hardware/nuclone_LPC824M201JHI33/README.md) that contains all the electronics to make a wearable device or datalogger.
# HSI (Hardware Software Interface)
This applies to a project that has a embedded software component. Describe what each pin/bus does, what it is connected to, what its function is and some "safe" behaviour when starting up.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* Charging IC from microchip
* Any SPI serial flash
