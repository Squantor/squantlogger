# Nuclone development board for the LPC1114JBD48
Development board for the LPC1114 in TQFP48 package, actually any LPC111X series in the TQFP48 package can be mounted but the LPC1114 is mostly used.
# HSI (Hardware Software Interface)
* PIO0_0 is the reset pin but there is a default open jumper to a header pin
* PIO0_10 is the SWCLK/TCK pin but there is a default open jumper to a header pin
* PIO1_3 is the SWDIO/TMS pin but there is a default open jumper to a header pin
* The on board crystal is 12MHz in 3225 package.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* Produce at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* [LPC1114FBD48/302,1](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/NXP-MCU_NXP_LPC1114FBD48-302_LPC1114FBD48-302_C9872.html)
