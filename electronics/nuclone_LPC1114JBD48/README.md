# Nuclone development board for the LPC1114JBD48
Development board for the LPC1114 in TQFP48 package, actually any LPC111X series in the TQFP48 package can be mounted but the LPC1114 is mostly used.
# HSI (Hardware Software Interface)
* Define crystal pins
* what pins are connected to SWD
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* [LPC1114FBD48/302,1](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/NXP-MCU_NXP_LPC1114FBD48-302_LPC1114FBD48-302_C9872.html)
