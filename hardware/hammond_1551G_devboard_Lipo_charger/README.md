# Hammond 1551G development board description
This development board fits a [Hammond 1551G project box](http://www.hammondmfg.com/pdf/1551G.pdf).
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* Think of a project description
* schematic entry
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
Due to the general shortage of passive components, where mentioned, just whatever you can find.
* component from [farnell](https://www.farnell.com/)
* Generic resistor in 0402 housing with a value
* Generic capacitor in 0603 housing with a value
